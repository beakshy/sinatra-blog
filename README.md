Sinatra-Blog
============

A basic blog written in Ruby and Sinatra. I built this project to learn ruby.

<b>Install dependencies</b>
<pre>bundle install</pre>

<b>Boot up server</b>
<pre>rackup config.ru</pre> or <pre>ruby app.rb</pre>

This project also includes my front-end boiler plate, which can be found here. <a href="https://github.com/beakshy/require-bower-grunt-boilerplate">https://github.com/beakshy/require-bower-grunt-boilerplate</a>
